# MindLyf Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and configurations for the MindLyf infrastructure, focusing on compliance with healthcare regulations and protection of sensitive mental health data.

## Security Principles

The MindLyf platform follows these security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions needed for functionality
3. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **Regular Auditing**: Continuous monitoring and auditing of security controls
5. **Secure Development**: Security integrated throughout the development lifecycle

## Compliance Requirements

MindLyf is designed to comply with:

- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **PDPO**: Personal Data Protection Ordinance (Hong Kong)

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

The MindLyf infrastructure uses a secure VPC configuration:

- **Private Subnets**: Services run in private subnets with no direct internet access
- **NAT Gateway**: Controlled outbound access
- **Security Groups**: Granular access controls between services
- **Network ACLs**: Additional subnet-level security

### AWS WAF and Shield

- **WAF Rules**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DDoS and brute force attacks
- **IP Restrictions**: Geographic restrictions based on compliance requirements

## Data Encryption

### Encryption at Rest

All data is encrypted at rest:

- **RDS**: AES-256 encryption with KMS keys
- **S3**: Server-side encryption
- **EBS Volumes**: Encrypted using KMS
- **ElastiCache**: Encryption enabled

### Encryption in Transit

All communications are encrypted in transit:

- **TLS 1.2+**: Required for all API communications
- **HTTPS Only**: No unencrypted HTTP traffic allowed
- **Internal Services**: mTLS for service-to-service communication

## Kubernetes Security

### Pod Security

- **Pod Security Policies**: Enforce security contexts
- **Non-root Containers**: Services run as non-root users
- **Read-only Filesystems**: When possible
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion

### Security Contexts

Example security context for services:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

### Network Policies

Network policies restrict pod-to-pod communication:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
  namespace: mindlyf
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

Services have specific network policies allowing only required connections.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Cognito

User authentication is handled by AWS Cognito:

- **MFA**: Multi-factor authentication enforced for all users
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts

### IAM

AWS IAM follows least privilege principle:

- **Service Roles**: Minimal permissions for each service
- **Cross-Account Access**: Controlled via IAM roles
- **Temporary Credentials**: No long-lived credentials

### Kubernetes RBAC

RBAC policies restrict service permissions:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: mindlyf
  name: service-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps", "secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

## Secrets Management

### Kubernetes Secrets

- **Encrypted Secrets**: Kubernetes secrets encrypted at rest
- **External Secrets**: Integration with AWS Secrets Manager

### AWS Secrets Manager

- **Service Credentials**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Rotation**: Automatic credential rotation
- **Auditing**: Access logging enabled

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- **CloudTrail**: AWS API activity logging
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection
- **Security Hub**: Compliance checks
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alerting on security events

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated detection of security events
2. **Containment**: Automated and manual containment procedures
3. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis tools and processes
4. **Remediation**: Standard procedures for different incident types
5. **Recovery**: Restore to secure state
6. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Lessons learned and improvements

## Security Update Process

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans of infrastructure and applications
2. **Patch Management**: Process for reviewing and applying patches
3. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of dependencies
4. **Container Image Scanning**: Scanning for vulnerabilities in container images

## Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration testing
- **Vulnerability Assessments**: Quarterly internal assessments
- **Automated Security Testing**: Part of CI/CD pipeline

## Compliance Auditing

- **HIPAA Audit**: Annual HIPAA compliance audit
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual SOC 2 audit
- **Internal Audits**: Quarterly internal compliance reviews
