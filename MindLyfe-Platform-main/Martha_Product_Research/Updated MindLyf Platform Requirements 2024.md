* Contextual help tooltips provide guidance on correct input formats.

**SP 16: General Errors**
* Displayed as a notification at the top of the registration form (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later").
* Error logging for system administrators to identify and resolve issues.

**C.3 ERROR HANDLING DURING VERIFICATION**

**SP 17: Verification Code Error**
* If the wrong verification code is entered, the user receives an error message ("Invalid code. Please check and try again.").
* Users can request a new code, with a limit on the number of resend attempts to prevent misuse.
* Alternative verification methods are offered if repeated failures occur.

**SP 18: Email / SMS Delivery Failure**
* If the verification email/SMS fails to send, the user receives an error notification and is prompted to check their email/phone number and try again.
* System automatically attempts alternative delivery methods if primary method fails.
