understanding, and agreement before any therapeutic sessions take place. Below is how the
MindLyfe platform will ensure informed consent is met:
3.3.1 Pre-Session Consent Process
The MindLyfe platform integrates an automated and mandatory consent process that must be
completed by both clients and therapists before any therapy sessions can occur.
For Clients:
▪ SP 306: Consent Form Display:
➢ Before the first session (both individual and organizational clients), a detailed consent
form is displayed upon logging into the platform or scheduling a session.
➢ The consent form includes information about:
❖ Purpose of Therapy: Explanation of the goals and nature of therapy.
❖ Confidentiality and Data Privacy: How their personal data and session
information will be protected and stored, including PDPO, HIPAA and GDPR
compliance.
❖ Session Recording: Information about whether sessions will be recorded and
the client's right to deny or agree to recording.

withdraw from therapy, request their data) and responsibilities during therapy.
58
❖ Payment and Billing Policies: Detailed explanation of session fees, billing
schedules, cancellation policies, and no-show penalties.
▪ SP 307: Client Confirmation:
➢ The client must read and check an agreement box confirming they understand and
agree to the terms of the consent form.
➢ A digital signature or biometric verification (if supported) is required to complete
the consent process.
▪ SP 308: Informed Consent Quiz (Optional):
➢ To further ensure understanding, the platform can include a short-informed consent
quiz to test the client’s comprehension of key points (e.g., privacy, session
expectations, billing). This option ensures that the client has fully understood the
consent form.
▪ SP 309: Session Scheduling Block:
➢ Clients will not be allowed to schedule a session until the informed consent form is
signed. The platform alerts the client to complete the consent process if they attempt
to book without it.
▪ SP 310: Consent Review and Updates:
➢ For long-term clients, informed consent forms must be renewed annually or if
significant changes occur in platform policies, privacy standards, or therapy
approaches. Clients are notified when it’s time to re-sign a new form.

respected:
Session Start Agreement:
• SP 313: At the start of every session, the MindLyfe platform provides a brief reminder of the
consent terms (confidentiality, data privacy, rights) which clients can review. They must click
to confirm that they still agree to these terms before the session begins.
Session Recording Consent:
• SP 314: If the therapist or organization wishes to record the session for any purpose (e.g.,
training, client progress), the platform prompts the client for their explicit consent just before
the session begins. The session will not be recorded without this consent.
• SP 315: This consent is captured and stored in the client’s profile for future reference.
3.3.3 Informed Consent for Organizational Clients
For organizational clients, the process is similar to individual clients but includes some additional
steps:
60
▪ SP 316: Organizational Agreements:

➢ SP 318: The platform automatically logs all consent interactions for both clients and
therapists, including timestamps of when forms were signed, digital signatures, and
any updates to the consent terms.
➢ SP 319: These logs are stored securely and can be reviewed by administrators or in
the case of legal inquiries.
▪ Audit Trails:
➢ SP 320: The platform generates an audit trail of all actions related to informed
consent, ensuring that there is always clear documentation if consent is revoked,
altered, or needs to be referenced.
61
3.3.5 Error Handling and Reminders

➢ SP 321: If the client or therapist does not complete the consent process, they will not
be allowed to proceed with the session. A clear error message is displayed, instructing
them to complete the necessary steps.
• Consent Expiration Notifications:
➢ SP 322: The platform automatically sends reminders to clients and therapists when
their consent needs renewal (e.g., annually or due to policy updates).
• Revoking Consent:
➢ SP 323: Clients have the right to revoke consent at any time. The platform provides
a straightforward process for clients to withdraw from services or revoke previously
given consent (e.g., for session recordings).
