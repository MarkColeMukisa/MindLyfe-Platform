# MindLyf Notification & Engagement Strategy

## Purpose

## 1. Notification Channels & Use Cases

### a) SMS Reminders
- **Appointment reminders, therapy session prompts, daily wellness check-ins, and motivational nudges.**
- SMS is highly effective for time-sensitive, behavior-change, and health-related reminders, especially in regions with high mobile penetration and limited internet access.
- Personalization (using the user's name, context, and goals) increases impact and retention <mcreference link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6112101/" index="2">2</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211035/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

### b) Email Notifications
- **Onboarding, progress summaries, personalized content, newsletters, and transactional updates.**
- Best for rich content, educational material, and periodic engagement.
- Use dynamic content and behavioral triggers for higher open and click rates.

### c) WhatsApp Reminders
- **Session reminders, payment prompts, personalized nudges, and support follow-ups.**
- WhatsApp is widely used in Africa and offers high open rates and conversational engagement.
- Leverage WhatsApp Business API for automated, opt-in notifications and two-way support <mcreference link="https://www.unifonic.com/blogs/whatsapp-notifications-boost-customer-engagement" index="4">4</mcreference>.

### d) Push Notifications (Mobile/Web)
- **Real-time alerts, motivational streaks, new content, and urgent updates.**
- Actionable push notifications (with buttons) drive in-app engagement and habit formation <mcreference link="https://www.moengage.com/learn/push-notification-best-practices/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

### e) In-App Reminders
- **Session countdowns, daily check-ins, and personalized wellness tips.**
- Contextual, non-intrusive reminders that reinforce user goals and platform value.

## 2. Best Practices for Engagement & Personalization

- **Personalize every message:** Use the user's name, preferences, and behavioral data to tailor content and timing.
- **Timing matters:** Send reminders at optimal times (e.g., morning for wellness check-ins, 1 day before appointments) and allow users to set preferences <mcreference link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211035/" index="3">3</mcreference>.
- **Multi-channel orchestration:** Combine SMS, email, WhatsApp, and push for critical journeys (e.g., onboarding, therapy adherence, payment reminders).
- **Opt-in and control:** Let users choose channels, frequency, and types of notifications. Provide easy opt-out and granular controls.
- **Actionable content:** Include clear calls-to-action (e.g., "Join Session," "Reschedule," "Check Progress").
- **A/B test and optimize:** Continuously test message content, timing, and channels for maximum engagement.
- **Respect privacy and compliance:** Ensure all notifications comply with PDPO, GDPR, and local regulations. Never share sensitive health info via insecure channels.
