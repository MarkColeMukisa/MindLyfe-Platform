Please follow this core rule for all code modifications:
**Only apply or suggest code changes when you're â‰¥ 95% confident that the change is correct, safe, and contextually appropriate.**
If you're < 95% confident:
- DO NOT auto-apply changes
- Show a disclaimer and ask clarifying questions
- Offer multiple code paths if the solution is ambiguous

This rule is mandatory for critical areas like auth, database writes, and AI integration.
