🚨 Project Rule – MindLyf Compliance 🚨

You must follow the project’s official documentation and architectural standards at all times. This includes:

✅ Using NestJS + TypeScript for backend services  
✅ Using Python (FastAPI/Flask) for AI microservices  
✅ Hosting on AWS (use ECS Fargate, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)  
✅ Integrating OpenAI via a secure AI Service Layer  
✅ Enforcing data privacy, consent management, and audit logging  
✅ Following the documented AI-powered features (LyfBot, Journaling, Recommendations)

❌ Do NOT introduce alternative stacks, libraries, or frameworks unless the documentation allows or the user asks for it.  
❌ Do NOT rewrite service structure, routing layers, or messaging queues without justification aligned to the architecture.

If uncertain about alignment with project docs, ask the user before proceeding.
