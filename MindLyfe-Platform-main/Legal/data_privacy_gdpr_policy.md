## 5. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We primarily process your personal data under the following legal bases:

*   **Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR):**
    *   We rely on your consent for certain processing activities, such as:
        *   Processing sensitive personal data (e.g., health information, journal entries related to mental well-being) for providing personalized services, therapy, or AI-driven insights.
        *   Sending you direct marketing communications (e.g., newsletters, promotional offers).
        *   Placing non-essential cookies and using similar tracking technologies (as detailed in our [Cookie Policy](#cookie-policy)).
        *   Collecting precise location data from your mobile device.
        *   Sharing your data with third parties for purposes not directly related to providing the core service, where your explicit permission is sought.
    *   Where we rely on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

*   **Performance of a Contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR):**
    *   We process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. This includes:

        *   Providing the core functionalities of MindLyfe.org Services as described in our Terms and Conditions.
        *   Processing your payments for subscription services.
        *   Communicating with you about your account or service-related matters.

*   **Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR):**
    *   We process your personal data for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Our legitimate interests include:
        *   Improving and developing our Services, including our AI features.
        *   Ensuring the security and integrity of our platform and protecting against fraud and abuse.
        *   Conducting analytics and research to understand user behavior and enhance user experience (often using aggregated or de-identified data).
        *   Personalizing content and features (where not requiring explicit consent for sensitive data).
        *   Enforcing our legal rights and defending against legal claims.
        *   For administrative, IT services, network security, and fraud prevention purposes within our organization.
    *   Where we rely on legitimate interests, we have carried out a balancing test to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights.

*   **Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR):**
    *   We may process your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject. This may include:
        *   Responding to lawful requests from public authorities (e.g., law enforcement, courts).
        *   Complying with financial reporting, tax, or other regulatory requirements.
        *   Fulfilling our obligations under data protection laws (e.g., responding to data subject requests).

*   **Vital Interests (Article 6(1)(d) GDPR):**
    *   In rare circumstances, we may process personal data if it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person (e.g., in an emergency situation where an individual's health or safety is at risk).

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information for any specific processing activity, please contact us using the details provided in the "[Contact Us](#contact-us)" section.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

MindLyfe.org is committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the personal data we collect. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We may share your personal data in the following circumstances:

*   **With Your Consent:**
    *   We will share your personal data with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so. For example, if you choose to share your MindLyfe journal entries or progress with your therapist, a family member, or another third-party application.

*   **Service Providers:**
    *   We engage trusted third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., payment processors, cloud hosting providers, data analytics services, customer support tools, email delivery services, AI service providers). These service providers are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide these services to us and are obligated to protect your data under contractual agreements and applicable data protection laws.

*   **Therapists and Healthcare Professionals (Teletherapy Services):**
    *   If you use our teletherapy services, your personal data, including sensitive health information shared during sessions, will be accessible to the licensed therapist(s) providing care to you. This sharing is essential for the provision of therapy services. Therapists are bound by professional confidentiality obligations and data protection agreements.

*   **AI Service Providers:**
    *   Some features, like LyfBot, utilize third-party AI technology providers. While we strive to use de-identified or aggregated data where possible, some interactions may involve processing of personal data by these providers under strict contractual terms that ensure data protection and confidentiality, consistent with this policy.

*   **Community Features:**
    *   If you participate in community forums or other social features on MindLyfe.org, information you post (e.g., username, comments, shared content) may be visible to other users of those features. You should be mindful of the information you share in these public or semi-public spaces.

*   **Business Transfers:**
    *   In the event of a merger, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of MindLyfe's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, your personal data may be among the assets transferred. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.

*   **Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights:**
    *   We may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
        *   Comply with a legal obligation, subpoena, court order, or other lawful request by public authorities.
        *   Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of MindLyfe, our users, or the public.
        *   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services.
        *   Protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public.
        *   Enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements.

*   **Aggregated or De-identified Data:**
    *   We may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, with third parties for research, analytics, marketing, or other purposes. For example, we may share aggregated user statistics to describe our services to prospective partners or for academic research.

## 7. Third-Party Recipients

Our service providers and partners who may receive your personal data include, but are not limited to:

*   **Cloud Hosting Providers:** (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure) for storing our data and running our applications.
*   **Payment Processors:** (e.g., DPO Pay, Stripe, PayPal) for securely processing payments.

*   **Licensed Therapists & Healthcare Networks:** For users of our teletherapy services.

We conduct due diligence on our third-party recipients to ensure they have appropriate technical and organizational measures in place to protect your personal data and comply with applicable data protection laws. We enter into data processing agreements (DPAs) with these recipients where required by law, outlining their obligations with respect to your data.

## 8. Data Security

MindLyfe.org takes the security of your personal data very seriously. We implement a range of technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:

*   **Encryption:**
    *   Data in transit is encrypted using industry-standard protocols such as TLS/SSL.
    *   Data at rest (e.g., in our databases) is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    *   Sensitive data, such as journal entries and therapy communications, receives heightened encryption and access controls.

*   **Access Controls:**
    *   Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel who have a legitimate business need to access it.
    *   We use role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit access based on job responsibilities.
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for administrative access to our systems.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other network security measures are in place to protect our infrastructure.
    *   Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are conducted to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses.

*   **Secure Development Practices:**
    *   Our software development lifecycle (SDLC) incorporates security best practices, including code reviews, security testing, and secure coding training for our developers.

*   **Data Minimization and Anonymization/Pseudonymization:**
    *   We collect only the personal data necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.
    *   Where feasible, we use anonymized or pseudonymized data for research, analytics, and AI model training to reduce privacy risks.

*   **Incident Response Plan:**
    *   We have an incident response plan in place to address potential data breaches or security incidents promptly and effectively, including notification procedures as required by law.

*   **Employee Training and Awareness:**
    *   Our employees and contractors receive regular training on data privacy and security best practices.

*   **Third-Party Vendor Security:**
    *   We conduct due diligence on the security practices of our third-party service providers and require them to adhere to appropriate security standards through contractual agreements.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, it's important to remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You also play a crucial role in keeping your data safe by using strong, unique passwords, enabling MFA where available, and protecting your account credentials.

## 9. Data Retention

We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, and to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

*   **The duration of your relationship with us:** We generally retain your account information and data associated with your use of the Services for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Services.
*   **The nature and sensitivity of the personal data:** More sensitive data may have shorter retention periods or be subject to specific anonymization/deletion protocols.
*   **Our legal and regulatory obligations:** We are required to retain certain information for specific periods under applicable laws (e.g., financial records, data related to healthcare services under HIPAA if applicable, PDPO requirements).
*   **The purposes for which we process the data:** If data is needed for ongoing legitimate business purposes (e.g., fraud prevention, security, improving our services), it may be retained.
*   **Whether the data is needed for dispute resolution or to defend or assert legal claims.**

When your personal data is no longer required for these purposes, we will securely delete or anonymize it. Anonymized data, which can no longer be associated with you, may be retained indefinitely for research, statistical analysis, and service improvement.

If you request deletion of your account, we will process your request in accordance with applicable law and our internal policies. Some data may be retained in backups for a limited period for disaster recovery purposes, or where required by law, before being permanently deleted.

You can request more information about our data retention policies by contacting us at [privacy@mindlyfe.org].

## 10. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR & Other Regions)

Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR in the EEA, UK data protection laws, PDPO in Hong Kong, CCPA/CPRA in California, and others), you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. MindLyfe.org is committed to upholding these rights. These may include:

*   **The Right to Access (Article 15 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to request copies of your personal data that we hold and information about how we process it.

*   **The Right to Rectification (Article 16 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you.

*   **The Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten') (Article 17 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to request that we delete your personal data under certain conditions, for example, if the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, you withdraw consent, or the data has been unlawfully processed.

*   **The Right to Restrict Processing (Article 18 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data or have objected to processing, pending verification.

*   **The Right to Data Portability (Article 20 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to request that we transfer the personal data that you have provided to us to another organization, or directly to you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, where processing is based on your consent or on a contract and is carried out by automated means.

*   **The Right to Object to Processing (Article 21 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where it is based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If you object to processing for direct marketing, we will no longer process your data for such purposes.

*   **Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling (Article 22 GDPR):**
    *   You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, except under certain conditions (e.g., necessary for a contract, authorized by law, or based on your explicit consent).

*   **The Right to Withdraw Consent:**
    *   Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

*   **The Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority (Article 77 GDPR):**
    *   If you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country of residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.

**Exercising Your Rights:**

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [privacy@mindlyfe.org] or through the contact details provided in the "[Contact Us](#contact-us)" section. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month, in accordance with GDPR requirements. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**Specific Regional Rights:**

*   **California Residents (CCPA/CPRA):** If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights, including the right to know about personal information collected, disclosed, or sold, the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information (MindLyfe does not currently sell personal information in the traditional sense), and the right to non-discrimination for exercising your CCPA/CPRA rights. We will provide more specific information for California residents as applicable.
*   **Hong Kong Residents (PDPO):** Residents of Hong Kong have rights regarding access to and correction of their personal data under the PDPO.

We are committed to facilitating the exercise of your rights in accordance with all applicable laws.

## 11. Consent Management

At MindLyfe.org, we believe in providing you with clear choices and control over your personal data, especially where processing is based on your consent.

*   **Obtaining Consent:**
    *   We obtain your consent through clear, affirmative actions before collecting or processing your personal data for specific purposes where consent is the legal basis. This includes, for example, consent for sensitive data processing (like health-related journal entries used for personalized insights), non-essential cookies, direct marketing communications, or sharing data with certain third parties.
    *   Consent requests are presented in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, separate from other terms or information.

*   **Managing Your Consent Preferences:**
    *   You can manage your consent preferences at any time through your account settings on the MindLyfe platform or by using specific mechanisms provided (e.g., cookie consent banner, email unsubscribe links).
    *   Your account settings will provide granular options to control:
        *   Consent for processing sensitive data for specific features.
        *   Marketing communication preferences (email, push notifications).
        *   Cookie preferences (via our cookie management tool).
        *   Permissions for data sharing with connected third-party services (if applicable).

*   **Withdrawing Consent:**
    *   You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time for any processing activity that relies on your consent as its legal basis.
    *   Withdrawing consent is designed to be as easy as giving it. You can typically withdraw consent through the same interface or method you used to provide it (e.g., in-app settings, email links).
    *   Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
    *   If you withdraw consent for a particular processing activity, we will cease that specific processing. However, this may mean that certain features or services of MindLyfe.org that rely on that consent may no longer be available to you. We will inform you of any such consequences.

*   **Records of Consent:**
    *   We maintain records of consent obtained from users to demonstrate compliance with data protection regulations.

For any questions or assistance regarding managing your consent, please contact us at [privacy@mindlyfe.org].

## 12. International Data Transfers

MindLyfe is a global platform, and your personal data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the UK, which may have different data protection laws.

When we transfer your personal data to such countries, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws. These safeguards include:

*   **Adequacy Decisions:** Transferring personal data to countries that the European Commission (or relevant UK authority) has deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection.
*   **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):** Implementing Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (or the UK Information Commissioner's Office for UK data transfers) between MindLyfe and the recipient of the data in the third country. These clauses contractually oblige the recipient to protect the data to the standards required within the EEA/UK.
*   **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs):** For intra-group transfers, we may rely on approved BCRs where applicable.
*   **User Consent:** In some specific situations, we may rely on your explicit consent for the transfer, after informing you of the potential risks.
*   **Other Legal Mechanisms:** Relying on other permitted legal mechanisms for international data transfers, such as specific derogations under Article 49 GDPR if applicable (e.g., transfer necessary for the performance of a contract with you).

Our primary data hosting providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) offer robust security and compliance frameworks and have mechanisms in place to support lawful international data transfers.

By using our Services, you understand that your personal data may be transferred to our facilities and to those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, located in various countries around the world. We are committed to ensuring that any such transfers are lawful and that your data remains protected to the standards outlined in this policy.

If you have questions about the safeguards we use for international data transfers, please contact us at [privacy@mindlyfe.org].

## 13. Data Breach Notification

MindLyfe.org has implemented robust security measures to protect your personal data. However, in the unfortunate event of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we are committed to notifying you and the relevant supervisory authorities without undue delay, in accordance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR Article 33 and 34, PDPO requirements).

A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

Our notification to you will, where feasible, include:
*   A description of the nature of the personal data breach.
*   The name and contact details of our Data Protection Officer (DPO) or other contact point where more information can be obtained.
*   A description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach.
*   A description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by MindLyfe to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

We will also notify the competent supervisory authority (e.g., the relevant Data Protection Authority under GDPR) of the breach within the timeframe required by law (typically 72 hours of becoming aware of it), unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

We maintain an internal register of all data breaches, regardless of their perceived risk level.

## 14. Children's Privacy

MindLyfe.org's Services are not primarily directed at individuals under the age of 16 (or a higher age of digital consent if stipulated by local law, e.g., 13 in the U.S. under COPPA, or other ages in specific jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age without verifiable parental consent.

*   **Age Verification:** We may implement age verification measures during account registration to prevent underage use without consent.
*   **Parental Consent:** If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under the applicable age of consent without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal data without their consent, they should contact us immediately at [privacy@mindlyfe.org].
*   **Services for Minors (with Consent):** In some cases, with appropriate parental or guardian consent, minors above a certain age (e.g., 13-15 with parental consent, or 16+ independently, depending on jurisdiction and service type) may be able to use certain features of MindLyfe. The specific terms and consent mechanisms for such use will be clearly outlined.

We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to help enforce this policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data through our Services without their permission.
