## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer, mobile device, or any other device when you visit a website or use an online service. Cookies are widely used by website owners and their service providers to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and personalized experiences.

Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through our Platform, such as advertising, interactive content, analytics, and enhanced security measures. The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits our Platform and when it visits certain other websites or services.

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Platform. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Platform. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.

They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other websites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.

## Session Management

MindLyfe.org uses a sophisticated persistent session management system with the following features:

### Database Storage

All session information is securely stored in our encrypted database rather than in client-side cookies. This approach enhances security by reducing the risk of session hijacking and other client-side vulnerabilities.

### Session Lifecycle

- **Creation**: A new session is created when you log in or start using our Platform as a guest.
- **Persistence**: Sessions remain active for a limited period (typically 30 days for authenticated users and 24 hours for guest users).
- **Renewal**: Sessions are automatically renewed with each interaction with our Platform.
- **Expiration**: Sessions expire after the designated period of inactivity.

### Automatic Cleanup

Our system automatically removes expired sessions from the database to maintain system performance and data minimization principles. This cleanup process runs daily and ensures that outdated session data is not retained unnecessarily.

### Session Revocation

You can actively terminate all your active sessions through your account settings under "Security" > "Active Sessions." This feature allows you to log out from all devices simultaneously, which is particularly useful if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.

### Detailed Metadata Tracking

For security and service improvement purposes, our session management system records the following metadata with each session:

- Device type, model, and operating system
- Browser type and version
- IP address (stored in a pseudonymized format)
- Geographic location (country and region level only)
- Login timestamps and activity patterns
- Session duration and interaction frequency

This metadata helps us detect suspicious activities, improve Platform performance, and provide personalized support when needed.
