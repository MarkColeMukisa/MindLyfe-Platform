**Technology Choice:** Signal Protocol

**Rationale:**
- Provides strong end-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy
- Well-audited and widely trusted implementation
- Supports multi-device key management
- Open-source with active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Matrix Olm/Megolm: Strong alternative but less widespread adoption
- Custom implementation: Rejected due to security risks of custom cryptography

#### 3.1.2 Key Management Architecture

**Client-Side Key Generation:**
- Asymmetric key pairs generated on client devices
- Private keys never leave client devices
- Public keys registered with key server

**Key Distribution:**
```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Client A │────▶│  Key Server │◀────│ Client B    │
└─────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
     │                                      │
     │           Exchange public keys       │
     ├─────────────────────────────────────▶│
     │                                      │
     │           Establish session          │
     ├─────────────────────────────────────▶│
     │                                      │
     │         Encrypted messages           │
     ├─────────────────────────────────────▶│
     │                                      │
```

**Session Establishment:**

- Per-document encryption keys
- Key wrapping with user's public key

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Pseudocode for document encryption
function encryptDocument(document: Document, userPublicKey: PublicKey): EncryptedDocument {
  // Generate random document encryption key
  const documentKey = crypto.generateRandomKey(256);
  
  // Encrypt document with document key
  const iv = crypto.generateRandomIV();
  const encryptedContent = crypto.aesGcmEncrypt(document.content, documentKey, iv);
  
  // Wrap document key with user's public key
  const wrappedKey = crypto.asymmetricEncrypt(documentKey, userPublicKey);
  
  return {
    id: document.id,
    encryptedContent,
    iv,
    wrappedKey
  };
}
```
