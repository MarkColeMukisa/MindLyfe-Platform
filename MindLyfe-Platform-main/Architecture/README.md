# MindLyfe Platform Architecture

## Overview
This directory contains the architectural design documents for the MindLyfe mental health platform. As the AI Software Architect, I've structured our architectural approach to ensure a secure, scalable, and modular system that supports the platform's requirements for AI-enhanced therapy, wearable integration, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Security by Design**
   - Zero-trust architecture
   - Defense in depth
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Privacy by design

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling of stateless services
   - Vertical scaling for data-intensive operations
   - Geographic distribution for global resilience
   - Elastic resource allocation

3. **Modularity**
   - Domain-driven design
   - Bounded contexts
   - Clear service boundaries
   - Standardized interfaces

4. **Observability**
   - Distributed tracing
   - Centralized logging
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Anomaly detection

5. **Compliance**
   - HIPAA-compliant data handling
   - GDPR-ready architecture
   - PDPO compliance
   - Audit-friendly design

## Development Workflow

1. Architecture designs are created and reviewed before implementation
2. Technical design documents are created for each epic
3. Architecture decision records (ADRs) document key decisions
4. Regular architecture reviews ensure alignment with principles

## Collaboration

Architecture development involves close collaboration with:
- Backend team (@Harbi) for service implementation
- Security team (@Andrew) for security protocols
- ML team (@Arnold) for AI integration
- Mobile teams (@Tina & @Karmie) for consistent client architecture

## Next Steps

1. Complete initial security architecture blueprint (3 days)
2. Finalize system architecture design (3 days)
3. Schedule technical architecture review with team
4. Incorporate feedback and refine designs
5. Begin implementation of core architectural components
