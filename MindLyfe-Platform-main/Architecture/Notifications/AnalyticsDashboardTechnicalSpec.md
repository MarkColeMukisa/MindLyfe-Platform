# MindLyfe Analytics Dashboard - Technical Specification

This document provides the technical specifications for the MindLyfe Analytics Dashboard. This dashboard is designed to track, visualize, and analyze the performance of the notification and engagement systems within the MindLyfe platform.

## 1. System Overview

The Analytics Dashboard provides MindLyfe stakeholders (product managers, marketers, support teams) with actionable insights into how users interact with notifications and gamification features. It helps measure effectiveness, identify trends, and optimize strategies for better user engagement and platform growth.

### 1.1 Goals

- Provide a centralized view of key performance indicators (KPIs) for notifications and gamification.
- Enable tracking of notification delivery, engagement, and conversion rates across different channels and campaigns.
- Monitor gamification metrics such as feature adoption, achievement completion, and reward redemption.
- Offer customizable reports and data visualizations for different stakeholder needs.
- Facilitate A/B testing analysis for notification content and timing.
- Ensure data accuracy, security, and timely reporting.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Data Ingestion & Processing Layer

- **Event Streaming**: (Optional, for real-time) Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis to receive events from Notification and Gamification services.
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled jobs (e.g., using AWS Lambda, Airflow, or cron jobs with scripts) to aggregate data from operational databases (Notification DB, Gamification DB) into the Analytics DB/Data Warehouse.
- **Data Transformation**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean, normalize, and structure data for analytical querying.

### 2.2 Analytics Database / Data Warehouse

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with analytics extensions, ClickHouse, AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, or similar columnar database optimized for analytical workloads.
- **Schema**: Star or snowflake schema designed for efficient querying of aggregated metrics and dimensions.

### 2.3 Analytics API Service

- **Language/Framework**: Node.js with Express.js/NestJS (or align with existing backend stack).
- **Function**: Provides aggregated data to the frontend dashboard. Handles complex queries, caching, and authorization.

### 2.4 Frontend Dashboard UI

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript.
- **Charting Library**: Recharts, Chart.js, Nivo, or similar for data visualization.
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
- **Key Sections**:
    - Overview: High-level KPIs.
    - Notification Performance: Detailed metrics per channel, template, campaign.
    - Gamification Insights: Streak engagement, badge achievements, reward redemption.
    - User Segmentation: (Future) Analytics based on user segments.
    - Report Builder: (Future) Custom report generation.

## 3. Key Metrics & Visualizations

    - Channel preference distribution (e.g., % users enabling SMS).
    - DND usage patterns.
    - Opt-out rates by category.
    - Visualization: Pie charts, bar charts.

## 4. Data Model (Analytics DB/Data Warehouse - Example Aggregates)

```sql
-- Example Aggregate Table for Daily Notification Stats
CREATE TABLE daily_notification_summary (
    summary_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_type VARCHAR(50),
    template_id VARCHAR(255),
    campaign_id VARCHAR(255), -- Optional
    notifications_sent INT,
    notifications_delivered INT,
    notifications_opened INT,
    notifications_clicked INT,
    notifications_converted INT,
    notifications_failed INT,
    notifications_bounced INT,
    total_unsubscribes INT
);

-- Example Aggregate Table for Daily Gamification Stats
CREATE TABLE daily_gamification_summary (
    summary_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    feature_name VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., 'streaks', 'badges'
    active_users INT,
    new_engagements INT, -- e.g., new streaks started, new badges earned
    completions INT -- e.g., streaks completed, achievements unlocked
);

-- Dimension Tables (examples)
CREATE TABLE dim_channel (
    channel_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE -- 'SMS', 'Email', 'Push', etc.
);

CREATE TABLE dim_template (
    template_id_pk VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, -- Corresponds to NotificationTemplate.id
    template_name VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## 5. Technical Design

### 5.1 Data Flow

1.  **Event Generation**: Notification Service and Gamification Service emit events (e.g., `notification_sent`, `notification_opened`, `streak_started`, `badge_earned`) or write to operational DBs.
2.  **Data Collection**: Events are captured by a streaming platform (if real-time) or batch jobs read from operational DBs.
3.  **ETL Processing**: Raw data is transformed, cleaned, and aggregated into the analytics data model.
4.  **Data Storage**: Aggregated data is loaded into the Analytics DB/Data Warehouse.
5.  **API Layer**: Analytics API queries the Analytics DB to serve data to the frontend.
6.  **Visualization**: Frontend dashboard renders charts and tables based on API responses.

### 5.2 Analytics API Endpoints (Examples)

- `GET /analytics/notifications/summary?startDate=<date>&endDate=<date>&channel=<channel>&groupBy=<dimension>`
- `GET /analytics/notifications/engagement_funnel?templateId=<id>&startDate=<date>&endDate=<date>`
- `GET /analytics/gamification/feature_adoption?feature=<feature>&startDate=<date>&endDate=<date>`
- `GET /analytics/gamification/streaks_distribution?startDate=<date>&endDate=<date>`

### 5.3 Frontend Components (React)

- `DashboardLayoutComponent`: Main structure with navigation.
- `KPIWidgetComponent`: Displays a single key metric.
- `TimeSeriesChartComponent`: Reusable component for line charts.
- `BarChartComponent`: Reusable component for bar charts.
- `DataTableComponent`: Displays tabular data with sorting and filtering.
- `DateRangePickerComponent`: For selecting time periods for analysis.
- `FilterDropdownComponent`: For filtering by channel, template, etc.

## 6. Security and Access Control

- **Authentication**: Access to the dashboard and API will be restricted to authenticated MindLyfe staff.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to define what data and features users can access (e.g., admin vs. viewer roles).
- **Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization**: PII should be excluded or pseudonymized in the analytics database where possible, especially for broader trend analysis.
- **API Security**: Standard API security practices (HTTPS, input validation, rate limiting).

## 7. Implementation Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design the data processing pipeline and database to handle growing data volumes.
- **Performance**: Optimize queries and API responses for fast dashboard loading. Implement caching strategies.
- **Data Accuracy & Consistency**: Implement data validation checks throughout the ETL process. Ensure consistent definitions of metrics.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design for both backend and frontend components.
- **Cost**: Consider costs associated with data storage, processing, and analytics platform services.
- **Historical Data**: Plan for backfilling historical data if required.

## 8. Testing Strategy

- **Data Pipeline Tests**: Verify ETL jobs, data transformations, and accuracy of aggregated data.
- **API Tests**: Test Analytics API endpoints for correctness, performance, and security.
- **Frontend Tests**: Unit tests for React components, integration tests for UI interactions and data display.
- **E2E Tests**: Validate the flow from event generation to dashboard visualization.
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for the API and dashboard under expected usage.
- **Data Validation**: Compare dashboard metrics against raw data sources to ensure accuracy.

## 9. Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Analytics**: For metrics requiring immediate visibility.
- **User Segmentation**: Analyze metrics for specific user segments (e.g., new users, highly engaged users).
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast trends or predict user behavior (e.g., churn risk based on notification interaction).
- **Custom Report Builder**: Allow users to create and save their own reports.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for significant changes in KPIs.
- **Integration with External Analytics Tools**: Export data to tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Google Analytics.
