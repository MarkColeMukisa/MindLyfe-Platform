# MindLyfe System Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for the MindLyfe mental health platform. The architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and modular to support the platform's requirements for AI-enhanced therapy, wearable integration, and real-time communication. The system follows a microservices approach with domain-driven design principles to enable independent scaling, deployment, and evolution of components.

2. **Therapy Session Flow**
   - Scheduling: Client → API Gateway → Therapy Session Service → Database
   - Session: Client → Video Service → Recording Storage → AI Service
   - Post-processing: AI Service → Database → Notification Service → Client

3. **Wearable Data Flow**
   - Device → Mobile App → API Gateway → Wearable Integration Service
   - Processing: Wearable Data → Stream Processing → AI Service
   - Alerts: AI Service → Notification Service → Client

4. **Assessment Flow**
   - Client → API Gateway → Assessment Service → Database
   - Analysis: Assessment Data → AI Service → Therapy Session Service
   - Reporting: Assessment Data → Analytics Service → Client

### Event-Driven Interactions

- **User Events**: Registration, profile updates, preference changes
- **Session Events**: Scheduling, cancellations, completions
- **Clinical Events**: Assessment submissions, treatment milestones
- **System Events**: Service health, scaling events, deployments
